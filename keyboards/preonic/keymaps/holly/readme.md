# The default Preonic layout - largely based on the Planck's
Changes from the default layout:
- Moved bottom left CTRL, SUPER, ALT keys to follow standard ANSI layout
- Changed right space key to be shift
- Removed dvorak and colemak layers

Planned changes:
- change RAISE or LOWER layer to contain standard symbols
- add arrow keys to a layer
- ensure all normal symbols are accessible (such as colon)
