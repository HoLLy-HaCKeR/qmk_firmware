# HoLLy's Preonic layout

Changes from the default Preonic layout:
- **Changed right space key to be shift**
- **Reorder bottom left CTRL, SUPER, ALT keys** to follow standard ANSI layout
- **Move symbol keys from raise to lower layer** to make pressing them with shift easier
- **Add arrow keys to raised layer** on `jkl;`
- **Remove duplicated and strangely placed keys**, which originally came from the planck base
- Removed dvorak and colemak layers
- Add right control/alt/super/app keys on adjust layer
